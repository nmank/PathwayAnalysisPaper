## About The Project

The code for Pathway Analysis submission to Scientific Reports.



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Prerequisites

See requirements.txt


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Most experiments are run in the experiments directory.



<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [calcom_splits] all the partitioned data sets
- [cepa_pathways] the pathways generated using CePa
- [experiments] most of the code for running experiments
- [features] the set of features from all the experiments
- [ge_ora] over representation anaylsis for gene sets
- [jaccard_plots] plots for jaccard similarity
- [new_pw_edge_mtx_v2] probe-id networks
- [PathwayAnalysis] code for CPE, LPE and CePa
- [pathway_edges] protein-protein interation networks as gene interaction networks
- [pca_plots] plots of the PCA of gene expression and pathway expression
- [platform] platform files for the dataset to convert between probe IDs and gene IDs
- [preprocessing] geneID to probeID conversion along with other files
